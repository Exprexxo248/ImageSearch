# ImageSearch
Simple Image Search Machine using EfficientNet with PCA
This is the demo Search Machine for Shoe.

# Crawl Image
Mini Image Crawl program from website: https://bitis.com.vn/
With this module, I recommend you to use selenium tool to crawl information from dynamic web pages.

I came up with a way to do this crawl, I use ChromeDriverManager as Seleium Driver. For each div containing objects, I get the link of each product, then reach each product's page and get information from the tags. But this approach quickly ran into DDOS problems. Therefore I have redirected to only get information from the aggregate product page.

# Search Engine 
I reuse the template app from our past development.
